# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains the code for a Movie Recommendation System developed as a 6th semester college project. The system utilizes K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm, cosine similarity, and content-based filtering to recommend movies based on various features.

## Key Components
- 🔄 **Data Preparation:** Merging movie and credit datasets, extracting relevant features.
- 🛠️ **Feature Engineering:** Converting genres, keywords, cast, and crew into a usable format.
- ✂️ **Text Processing:** Utilizing stemming and CountVectorizer to create feature vectors.
- 📏 **Similarity Computation:** Applying cosine similarity to measure the closeness of movies.
- 🎯 **Recommendation Algorithm:** Generating movie recommendations based on calculated similarities.

## Evaluation Metrics
To ensure the effectiveness of the recommendation system, we employed various evaluation metrics:
- **Precision@k**
- **Recall@k**
- **Mean Squared Error**
- **Classification Report**
- **Confusion Matrix**

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
